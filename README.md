# threejs-practice
A rotating cube with different light sources are rendered.
This project is part of another project I did for school. 

### Running this locally
In order to get cube textures to run on a local machine, you will need to install an http-server (this is to prevent a CORS issue)
```
> npm install http-server -g
```
Once you have that installed, from your terminal run the following commands
```
> git clone https://github.com/ReySantosJr/threejs-practice.git
> cd threejs-practice
> http-server
```
The server will begin running on `localhost:8080` which you can open in your browser (usually, confirm this in your terminal)
